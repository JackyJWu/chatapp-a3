How to run:
1. Run 'npm install'
1. run 'npm start' or 'node index.js'     
2. on the browser enter 'localhost:3334'

Possible Issues: 
- If you are unable to run this file, please delete the 'node_modules' folder and rerun 'npm install' to reinstall the package dependencies.
- If the port is taken, change the port in 'index.js' to another number

*Additional Note* 
- Heroku required port 80 but I commented this out for submission
